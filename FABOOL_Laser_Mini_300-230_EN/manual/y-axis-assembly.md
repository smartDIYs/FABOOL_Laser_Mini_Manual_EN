## Frame Assembly
Assemble on flat, level surface.
First, insert two M5T nuts into V-slot 410mm.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_01.jpg">

Combine the previous V-slot 410mm, (for the vertical frame, turn the side with the M5T nuts inserted to the back), and the other two V-slots 410mm. Insert bracket where indicated in red.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_02.jpg">

Secure brackets with M4x8 low head bolts.  
*Do not tighten bolts all the way.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_03.jpg">

<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_04.jpg">

Slide the X-Axis unit from before into the assembled frame. Take note of the orientation of the X-Axis unit, the V-slot 410mm groove and the mini v wheel should align.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_05.jpg">

Install the final frame. Insert brackets where indicated in red and secure with M4x8 low head bolts.

### Frame Angle Check
Check that the frame meets at right angles. Use a right angle ruler to confirm. Given the characteristics of the aluminum frame, it may not form a perfect right angle unless there is a slight gap in the frame. There is no problem if there is such a gap. Prioritize making the corners perfectly square over closing the gap.

## Idler Pulley Plate and Y-Axis Motor Unit Installation
Install the idler pulley plate and Y-Axis motor unit.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_07.jpg">

First, insert two M5T nuts in the fore left and install the idler pulley plate using two M5x8 low head bolts. (Photo taken from left side.)  
*Final adjustments will be conducted later; refer to picture and temporarily fix the idler pulley so that it just makes contact with the v-slot 410mm.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_08.jpg">

<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_09.jpg">

Next, insert two M5T nuts in the left rear and attach the Y-axis motor unit with two M5x8 low head bolts.  
*When using the Y-axis motor unit, use the one with the small hole on the right side at the top when installed.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_10.jpg">

When installing, adjust the position so that the Y axis motor unit line and the end of the aluminum frame seen in the back are on a straight line. There is also a wire at the same position on the inside, so ensure that the wire is perfectly aligned with the tip of V-slot 410mm.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_11.jpg">

Ensure that the timing pulley is aligned with the groove of V-slot 410mm as shown in the following picture. (The picture is taken from the far side.) If it is off, loosen the two timing pulley caterpillar screws, adjust, and re-tighten them.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_12.jpg">
It should look like this.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_13.jpg">
Not like this.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_14.jpg">

Install the idler pulley plate and the Y-axis motor unit in the same way on the other side.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_15.jpg">

## Y-Axis Check, V-slot Adjustment
Manually check the operation of the Y axis. As shown in the following video, the X-axis unit falls down naturally when the main unit is upright.  
If you try to move the X-axis unit over the entire movable range and feel even a slight catch, turn the eccentric spacers on the left and right of the X-axis unit little by little and adjust to loosen.

## Timing Belt Installation
For those who purchased the 300x230 processing area unit, cut the timing belts to 1000mm.  
Install the timing belt using a cable tie as you did for the X-Axis. Insert the timing belt through mini v plate_R and secure it with a cable tie.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_20.jpg">

Insert into the front and back pulleys and secure to mini v plate_R with a cable tie. In order to adjust the tension of the belt later, allow some slack.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_21.jpg">

<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_22.jpg">

To tighten the timing belt, loosen the screw on the idler pulley plate side and retighten it while pulling as shown in the photo. Ensure that the timing belt is tight.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_23.jpg">

Install the timing belt on the other side in the same way, then pull the idler pulley plate and tighten the it.
<img src="./images/04/mini-300mm_04_26.jpg">
If there is extra material remaining of the timing belt, cut it off leaving about 20-30mm.  
Finally, cut off excess material from the cable tie.
